## Description

Welcome to the Spotify Music Artist Data Analysis repository! In this Jupyter notebook, I delve into a comprehensive data analysis of Spotify Songs and Music Artists, enriching it with country statistics data obtained from Kaggle.

3. **Genre Distribution by Country:** How does the genre distribution by country look like? Which countries tend to create specific types of music? Can we identify clusters?

4. **Correlations Between Music Genres and Countries:** Are there any interesting correlations between music genres, specific countries, and related country statistics?
